## Motivation :pencil2:

The Seattle Airbnb dataset provides a wealth of information for both travelers and hosts, as well as for businesses and policymakers interested in the impact of Airbnb on the local economy and housing market. By analyzing this dataset, we can gain insights into the most popular neighborhoods for Airbnb listings and more. This information can be used by travelers to find the best accommodations for their needs and budgets, and by hosts to optimize their listings and maximize their profits.

## Conclusion :checkered_flag:

In summary, the analysis of the Seattle Airbnb dataset shows that the average nightly rate for different types of listings varies greatly by neighbourhood. Additionally, the amenities available in listings are not related to the rating of the listing, while the highest correlated variable to a listing's rating is the host's response rate. Lastly, the size of a listing is not sufficient to predict the price of that listing. These findings highlight the importance of neighbourhood selection and responsiveness of the host in rating a listing, as well as considering other factors beyond size when predicting a listing's price.
